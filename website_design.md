<website_design>
The Nubble landing page is designed as a sophisticated, modern showcase for the AI-powered food tracking app. The design leverages the required dark gradient background (top: #143638 to bottom: #000000) to create a premium, tech-forward aesthetic that aligns perfectly with the app's dark UI.

The page opens with a compelling hero section featuring the Nubble logo prominently in the navbar, alongside a powerful headline about AI-powered nutrition tracking. The hero showcases the main app interface screenshot, giving visitors an immediate preview of the clean, intuitive design they can expect.

The layout flows naturally through three core feature sections, each highlighting a key aspect of the app using the provided screenshots:
1. Smart Calorie Tracking - showcasing the daily nutrition overview with circular progress indicators
2. Progress Monitoring - featuring the weight tracking and goal achievement interface  
3. Comprehensive Analytics - displaying the detailed stats and consumption tracking capabilities

Each feature section uses a side-by-side layout with the app screenshot on one side and compelling copy on the other, creating visual rhythm and allowing users to see exactly how each feature works in practice.

The design maintains visual consistency through careful use of the gradient background, clean typography, and the app's signature green accent color (#4ADE80) pulled from the screenshots. Strategic use of glassmorphism effects and subtle animations creates depth while keeping the focus on the app's functionality.

The page concludes with a compelling call-to-action section encouraging downloads, followed by a clean footer with essential links. Throughout the design, the dark theme creates perfect contrast for the bright, colorful app screenshots, making them the hero elements of each section.
